# Professional-portfolio

### A professional portfolio with all my progress in Data Science career.

The purpose of this repository is to create a place where I can upload all my code and applications developed by me in this new career ... Data Science.
It will function as a personal and professional portfolio and as a guide for all beginners trying to learn about this amazing career.
Remember, all the code here was the result of a lot of research and hours of online courses. These were my solutions for the proposed projects, but it doesn't mean that they are the only or the best out there.
I keep developing, improving and hopefully soon become a Data Scientist.
